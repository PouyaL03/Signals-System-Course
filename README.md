# Signal and Systems Course Projects and Homework

This repository contains the homework assignments and project for the Signal and Systems course, based on *Signals and Systems* by Alan V. Oppenheim. The course combines theoretical concepts with practical applications to provide a comprehensive understanding of signals and systems.

## Homework Assignments

### Theoretical Homework
1. **HW1**: Imaginary numbers, Signal and Systems features  


2. **HW2**: Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) Systems  

3. **HW3**: Fourier Series  

4. **HW4**: Time-Continuous Fourier Transform  

5. **HW5**: Discrete-Time Fourier Transform  

6. **HW6**: Laplace Transform, Z Transform, Sampling  

### Practical Homework
1. **CHW1**: Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) Systems  

2. **CHW2**: Frequency and LTI Applications  

## Project: JPEG Compression
The project involves implementing a **JPEG compression algorithm**, where students simulate the compression process using concepts such as the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and quantization techniques. The project provides an opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge of signal processing to a practical real-world problem. 

Key aspects of the project include:
- Compressing an image step-by-step using DCT, quantization, and encoding techniques.  
- Emphasis on clarity and proper commenting for code understanding.
